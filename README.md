# AI Study Planner

## Description
This project is a simple Python program that creates a basic 4-week study plan
based on a user's learning goal and available study time.

I built this project to practice Python programming and to understand how
simple decision logic can be used to support learning.

## How It Works
- The user selects a learning goal (AI or Software Engineering)
- The user enters available study hours per week
- The program outputs a suggested study plan

## How to Run
```bash
python main.py
